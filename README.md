lol Who knows what I'm doing


Hola fellow Humans,
My name is Debra van der Hoeven.  I am wife to Tyler van der Hoeven.
I typically prefer music creativity to code creativity, but since my husband does all this stuff, and I have no clue about any of it, I figured I probably should start learning. Also 2 other stupid reasons... 
1. Have you ever played Slither.io? Cause that game is addicting.  It's stupid and I hate it, but for some reason I think that if I try again I'll last longer, or get a higher score or something. Crazy thing is, you can't even win that game.  You will die at some point, and then you start back at level 1 just like the new guy who just started playing. It's insane, and those people who create those things make tons of money off other people wasting thier time.  I want to get in on this deal.  (kind of late I know... But I never got into flappy bird or angry birds.) 
2.  <-- Hey, that 2 just popped right up on it's own!  That's cool :Thumb:  Okay, so really number 2.  I was watching the Apple big announcement speech thing, and they are teaching code to kids in school. Like they want everyone to know it.  I went to school the years that they weren't really sure if cursive was important, but they didn't really have typing to replace it with yet, so I only really learned how to print.  I learned cursive after my mom took me out of school, and learned typing when I got a facebook... a really good way to learn if you ask me.  :) So anyway when I heard that everyone was going to learn, I figured it be a good thing for me to learn too.  

So here goes! Learning to shoot computer rockets off of skill share, in hopes of creating the newest and most addictive gaming app. (I know, I know, it's probably a lot harder than I think and I'll most likely fail, but don't crush my hopes and dreams just yet.. okay? okay) good. Bye.
